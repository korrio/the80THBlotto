# we aim to solve 80 THB lotto with "BLOCKCHAIN"

## we crate 2 "smart contract" to solve 2 problem. 
### better Thai Bath
a stable Thai bath coin but better. 100% back by foreign currency and will always priced at 33 BTHB : USDT

probably more stable than THB. (next version might include investment to improve value of BTHB. might named it EBTHB (even better THB)


### The80THBlotto
this one is a smart Thai lotto that 99% similar to Thai lotto (but also better)

- will sell at 80 BTHB (+ 15 BTHB platform fees)
- same prize as Thai lotto. but you can do it in the comfort of your home
- secure with smart contract and buzz word
- maintain by centralized oracle


# note

- it's a joke but the contract is fully functional. (the design spect in the readme.md is actually accurate)
- obviously unaudited. but feel free to try out. 
- WTFPL license. you can take it. maybe it might be good for hackathon or meme project.
